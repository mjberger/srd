\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
We have presented a  state redistribution algorithm to solve the small cell problem on cut cell meshes.  It is conservative, allows for overlapping temporary merging neighborhoods so is easy to implement, and is linearity preserving.   
Numerical experiments show that on smooth problems, second order accuracy is maintained, and the solution is not degraded by the postprocessing. For problems with shocks, the scheme maintains robustness at the cut cells.
We have shown experiments using SRD on two different base schemes, but it should be 
applicable to any underlying numerical method with
cell-centered variables.

We think that state redistribution should be applicable to 
different sets of equations, and to three-dimensional applications.
It also seems clear that the scheme can be extended to higher order accuracy, 
when used in conjunction with a 
higher order base scheme. We have already started extending this work to
3rd and 4th order accuracy. Higher order methods bring 
in many new features however, so we do not include that here.
