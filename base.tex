\section{Base Finite Volume Schemes}\label{sec:basefv}

Our computational results use two different finite volume schemes
to update the cut cell mesh, to show that SRD can be used in a
variety of situations.
We will refer to these as the base schemes. 
The  base scheme is applied to the entire mesh, including  
to the small cut cells, using the same time step $\Delta t$ for all cells.  
Since cut cells can have cell volumes that are
orders of magnitude smaller than the time step allowed by the full
cells, these will lead to instability without a stabilization algorithm.
SRD will be applied after each stage or step of the base scheme.

The question of computing gradients, and for problems with discontinuities limiting
those gradients, arises independently of which finite volume scheme is used. 
For the interior of the mesh when the stencil is completely regular (i.e. no cut
cells), standard schemes such as monotonicized central differencing can be applied.
For cut cells, we use a least squares gradient reconstruction algorithm which is
linearly exact.  We discuss two  limiting procedures for the cut cells in 
section \ref{sec:limit}. Our examples will always report which scheme was used.


\subsection{Method of Lines approach}
The simplest scheme is to use a spatial discretization over the entire
mesh, and apply a Runge-Kutta scheme in time. This is a well-known
standard approach
on regular Cartesian meshes. It is adapted for the cut cells by
using the  least squares reconstruction of the gradient mentioned above, and one of
the limiters described in section \ref{sec:limit}.

The spatial reconstruction in the cut cells is no longer
coordinate-aligned, and needs 
to include both $x$ and $y$ components of the gradient to 
reconstruct to the midpoint of the cell edge. This is indicated 
Figure \ref{fig:2dfig}  indicates this face location with a green $\times$.
Note that the time step restriction that results from the von Neumann 
stability analysis of this scheme applied to the linear advection equation is  (AG -
TRUE or this is for positivity?)
\begin{equation}
\Delta t \,  \max\left(\frac{u}{\Delta x},\frac{v}{\Delta y}\right) \leq \frac{1}{2} ,
\end{equation}
where $(u,v)$ is the propagation velocity.  

\subsection{MUSCL scheme}
The MUSCL scheme is a one step method that is second order accurate in
time. A series of MUSCL schemes  was originated by van Leer 
\cite{vanleer:muscl}. The version we use
\footnote{Thanks to Phil 
Colella for the original Cartesian mesh code and for helpful discussions on the shear
layer instability and artificial viscosity.}
is due to Colella \cite{Colella:Unsplit}.
The method is briefly sketched here so that we can describe how it was
adapted for cut cells. 

On a regular cell $(i,j)$ the interface values on the 
faces are computed at the half-step in time, and the left and right states
are passed to a Riemann
solver to compute the fluxes.
Using a Taylor series in space and time to second order around the
cell center, and using the equation to replace the derivative in time,  gives
\begin{equation}\label{taylor}
\begin{split}
q_{i+1/2,j}^{n+1/2} & = q_{i,j}^n + 
              \frac{\Delta t}{2} \frac{\partial q_{ij}^n}{\partial t} + 
              \frac{\Delta x}{2} \frac{\partial q_{ij}^n}{\partial x} \\[.08in]
            &  = q_{i,j}^n + \frac{\Delta t}{2} 
            (-\frac{\partial f_{ij}^n}{\partial x} -
             \frac{\partial g_{ij}^n}{\partial y})  +
             \frac{\Delta x}{2} \, \frac{\partial q_{ij}^n}{\partial x} \\[.08in]
            &  = q_{i,j}^n - \frac{\Delta t}{2} \, 
             \frac{\partial g_{ij}^n}{\partial y}  -
            ( \frac{\Delta t}{2} 
            \frac{\partial f_{ij}^n}{\partial q} -
             \frac{\Delta x}{2} ) \,\frac{\partial q_{ij}^n}{\partial x} . \\[.08in]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
After discretization, this will become the left state of the right interface
of cell $(i,j)$.

At regular cells, the term $\partial g / \partial y$ is computed by solving Riemann
problems in the vertical direction,  evaluating the flux $g$, and computing the
difference in fluxes divided bt $\Delta y$.
Since this only needs to be done to first order accuracy (the term is multiplied
by $\Delta t$)  no reconstruction to the cell edge  in the transverse 
direction was necessary,
and differencing the edge fluxes was appropriately cell-centered.
(For more details the reader is referred to \cite{Colella:Unsplit}.)
Note that it is this transverse derivative that provides the so-called corner coupling,
giving the MUSCL scheme a stability limit of
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:bigcfllimit}
\Delta t \, \max \left (\frac{u+c}{\Delta x} , \frac{v+c}{\Delta y} \right) < 1
\end{equation}

At the cut cells this procedure will no longer work.   We make two modifications to the
computation of the transverse derivatives. First,
the solution is reconstructed to the edge midpoint  for the transverse Riemann problem.
This takes care of the situation where a full cell is adjacent to a cut cell, and
the transverse flux would not be properly centered. This is the situation
in figure \ref{fig:2dfig} for cell $(i,j+1)$, for example.
Secondly, most cut cells will not have a flux on the other side to form a
transverse derivative, for example cell $(i+1,j)$. Even for cell $(i,j)$ is would
be difficult to find a location where the vertical fluxes could be accurately differenced.
For these cut cells, the transverse derivative term is handled by instead computing
$ \partial G / \partial y \, = \,  \partial G / \partial q \times \partial q / \partial y$,
as with the horizontal fluxes. This is linearly exact in the cut cells, 
if the gradients themselves are.

As remarked above, it is the transverse derivatives that allows for the larger time
step given in \eqref{eqn:bigcfllimit}.
However, in the neighborhood of a shock the derivatives will be limited, and
possibly set to zero.
If these terms were not used  in the volume mesh, the time step would be reduced to 
\begin{equation}
\Delta t \, \left (\frac{u+c}{\Delta x} + \frac{v+c}{\Delta y} \right) < 1
\end{equation}
which could be as small as half the larger limit in eq. \eqref{eqn:bigcfllimit}.
However, as shown in \cite{mjb:stability2} for one space dimension, 
boundary cells can have
a local {\em cfl} number that is up to twice the stable {\em cfl} of the regular
mesh and the overall scheme remains stable.  We have not found any stability
problems due to limiting of this term.  

The multi-dimensional MUSCL scheme due to Colella has several additional
features to robustly handle strong shocks, such as not included terms in the
interface state from characteristics that propagate away from the interface. These
do not change at the cut cells, so are not discussed here.  The
trickiest  term to adapt to cut cells was an artificial viscosity 
added to each flux with a
coefficient proportional to the negative divergence of the flow.  The original
code used a very large stencil to compute this divergence. We instead use a local 5
point centered stencil to compute $u_x$ and $v_y$, and take the max over a 3 by 3
neighborhood, so that cut cells get this dissipation too.

\subsection{Limiting gradients on cut cells}
Both schemes have to limit the reconstructed gradient for problems with shocks.
Two methods are compared in the some of the computational examples we present.
The simplest method is to use the Barth Jespersen limiter \cite{}. This can also be
used in the interior of the mesh, and so is closer to the base scheme. The other
limiter we investigate is the LP-limiter \cite{May_Berger_LP}.

The

Alternatively, To retain as much of the cut cell gradient as possible, we also test the LP limiter 
\cite{May_Berger_LP}. Note that both the cut cell and one adjacent uncut cell will
need this procedure.  The LP limiter is much less diffusive than the alternative 
BJ limiter at cut cells,
although sometimes this is preferable.We will always include which limiter is used
in the computational results.  Cells that are two away from a cut cell
can use any limiter with a standard stencil size.
