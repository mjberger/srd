In this section we show several computational experiments using state
redistribution to solve the Euler
equations. We will also use these
examples to examine 
properties of different gradient choices and base schemes. 
%We solve the conservation law \eqref{eq:conslaw2D} with different fluxes $\mathbf{F}$, to include both smooth and discontinuous
%solutions.

%\subsection{Linear fluxes}
%\subsubsection{Linear convergence study}
%We solve \eqref{eq:conslaw2D} with the flux $\mathbf{F}(u) = [-2\pi y u, 2\pi x u]$ and initial condition
%$$
%u_0(x,y) = w(\theta - \pi/2)
%$$
%where
%$$
%w(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\left( \text{erf}\left( \frac{\pi/6 - \theta}{\sqrt{4/100}} \right) + \text{erf}\left( \frac{\pi/6 + \theta}{\sqrt{4/100}} \right)\right)
%$$
%until the final time $T = 1$ on the domain enclosed by two concentric disks of 
%radii $R_1 = 0.751$ and $R_2 = 1.251$.  
%Figure \ref{fig:rotatinghillgrid} shows the computational domain 
%embedded in a $50 \times 50$ grid.  The exact solution is the initial condition 
%rotated about the point $(1.5,1.5)$, where $T=1$ corresponds to one solid 
%body rotation. This example IS FROM \cite{}, for comparison.  (AND ADD
%COMPARISON - ARE THEY OR WE MORE ACCURATE< BUT WE ARE EASIER).   
%The errors 
%measured in the $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ norms are provided in

\subsubsection{Linear advection with overlapping neighborhoods}
This first example demonstrates computing the solution for  linear
advection  in a complicated domain using SRD. 
Linear advection by itself is mostly useful in conjunction with
incompressible flow, or for tracer particles in an otherwise more
complicated flow. However we use 
this example to demonstrate  second order accurate convergence, and
that our algorithm can handle a substantial number of 
overlapping neighborhoods (see Figure \ref{fig:waveynumhoods}).

Using the streamfunction
$$
\phi = R - 0.25\sin(10\theta),
$$
with $R = \sqrt{(x-1.5)^2+(y-1.5)^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan((y-1.5)/(x-1.5))$, 
we define a linear flux based on the resulting divergence free 
velocity field, i.e.,  $\mathbf{F}(u) = [\phi_y u, -\phi_xu]$.  The 
characteristics of \eqref{eq:conslaw2D} lie on the isolines of the streamfunction.

A steady state solution to \eqref{eq:conslaw2D} with the above flux is given 
by the streamline function.  We start with the initial condition given by the 
streamline function $\phi$, and compute the solution until the final 
time $T = 10$ on a $100 \times 100$ grid.  Additionally, we set the flux 
normal to the domain boundary $\mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{n} = 0$.  This 
ensures that information does not leave the domain and should solution 
growth occur, this will more easily be noticed.
This problem is solved using the Method of Lines with TVD-RK2 time-stepping.

In Figure \ref{fig:waveyisolines}, we show the isolines of the exact solution 
at the initial and final times.  Additionally, Figure \ref{fig:waveynumhoods} 
shows the number of overlapping neighborhoods on each cell.  In this example, 
we have at most three overlapping neighborhoods,  concentrated where the 
boundary has high curvature.   We do not observe growth in the numerical 
solution as indicated by $L_1$, $L_\infty$ errors of the solution at the final 
time listed in Table \ref{tab:overlappingerrors}.  Although this experiment does 
not prove stability of our numerical scheme, not observing unbounded growth in the numerical solution is a necessary condition.

\subsection{Supersonic vortex study}\label{sec:ssv}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.45\textwidth}
\centering
\vspace*{-.2in}
\includegraphics[height=0.45\textwidth]{figs/ssvIllustration.png}
\caption{\sf The domain is discretized by 27 cells in each dimension, and
the exact density profile is shown. Ghost cells not shown.
\label{fig:ssvFig}}
\end{wrapfigure}

We compute the solution to a supersonic flow 
around a quarter circle.  This problem has often been used in accuracy 
studies \cite{aftosmis:acc} since it has an exact solution to the Euler
equations that is smooth, given by 
\begin{equation}
\rho = \rho_i \left \{ 1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2} \, M_i^2 \left [ 1 - (\frac{r_i}{r})^2
\right ] \right \} ^
{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}
\end{equation}
and $ u = a_i \, M_i \, (\frac{r_i}{r})\,  \sin (\theta)$, 
$ v = -a_i\,  M_i\,  (\frac{r_i}{r})\,  \cos(\theta)$, and
$ p = \rho^\gamma / \gamma$.
Here, the inner radius is $r_i = 1.0$,  the outer radius
is $r = 1.384$, $\rho_i=1$, and the Mach number on the inner circle
$M_i = 2.25$ in our experiments. 
In this
normalization we use $a_i = 1$, $p_i = 1/\gamma$. 
The second order MOL scheme is used, 
and the time step is chosen using a cfl of 1.0 in \eqref{eq:vn1}
based on the regular cell volume.

We march to steady state, until the maximum density update is 
below $10^{-10}$.  
The solution is smooth, so no limiters are needed.
The exact solution is used to set the ghost cells at the inflow and
outflow boundaries. The domain size is $[0,1.43]$ by $[0.0,1.4301]$ 
(slightly different to prevent mesh  degeneracies).  
The density profile and computational domain is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:ssvFig}.


This example will demonstrate the accuracy or SRD.
We also use this example to compare the accuracy of different
formulations for the cut cell and SRD neighborhood  gradients, since
as noted previously, gradients are an important part of this algorithm.
Table \ref{tab:ssv} we compares the accuracy of three such formulations.
For first order accurate gradients, we use a linear least squares 
reconstruction for both the irregular cell gradient (cut cells and their one-away neighbors) 
described in Section \ref{sec:limit}, and the SRD gradients, which 
update the cut cell solution after stabilization. Second order accurate 
gradients fit a quadratic for both
the cut cells and tiles as described in Section \ref{sec:limit}, 
but only the first derivative terms are used. 
As an intermediate experiment, we  fit a quadratic using least squares but 
treat the
cell averages as pointwise values at the cell centers. Here again
the second derivative terms are ignored.  We refer to this as "pointwise
quadratic reconstruction". Note that this is not a
second order accurate gradient, since the centroid value differs by $O(h^2)$
from the pointwise value at the centroid. Nevertheless, this is frequently
done since it is easier to implement. This is particularly true  for SRD
neighborhoods with irregular shapes.

        gradients, pointwise quadratic, and fully second order accurate gradients is shown. 
        Pointwise quadratic gradients have half of the error than first order gradients. 
        Truly second order accurate gradients are even better,
        especially on coarser grids. The convergence rate is given in
        parentheses. \label{tab:ssv}}
\end{table}
}

We measure the $L_1$ norm of the error in the volume,   $\sum_{i,j} \,
V_{ij} \lvert e_{ij } \rvert$ and at the boundary, $ \sum_{{i,j} \in \partial \Omega} \, A_{ij} \lvert e_{ij
} \rvert$.  Here
$e_{i,j}$ is the error at the cell centroid, and $A_{ij}$ is the length of the 
boundary segment in cut cell $(i,j)$.
These are given in Table \ref{tab:ex1_L1vol} and \ref{tab:ex1_L1bndry}. 
For easier comparison with other papers we also give the mesh size 
to a few digits. In  a cut cell mesh there are both solid and
flow cells, so the total number of cell is larger than the number of
flow cells, and not as easy to compare as the mesh spacing.
All interior cells use the same evolution scheme and gradients, so
the difference in the errors is solely due to the irregular cell
reconstruction scheme.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[height=3.0in]{figs/gradientConv.pdf}
		\caption{\sf Convergence in the L1 norm of the error in the entire 
			domain  (solid line), and along the boundary (dashed line).
			The reference line has slope 2 next to the domain error. The convergence
			rate at the boundary is between 1.38 and 1.5
			along the boundary.
			\label{fig:ssv}}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


Note that the error at the cut cells is larger than in the volume, and has a
lower convergence rate. Since the number of cut cells grows only
linearly with refinement, the $L_1$
accuracy in the entire flow field is still second order.  At the boundary,
Richardson extrapolation shows that the convergence rate seems to be
between 1.38 and 1.5.
This has also been found in other cut cell studies
\cite{KB:2006,nemec_tm14}, and is due to the irregularity of the
difference scheme at the cut cells, and the curved boundary. 
The next example will show the same behavior using local time stpeping,
which does not need SRD stabilization. It has the same convergence rate,
showing that this decrease is
not due to SRD.

Figure \ref{fig:ssv} and Table \ref{tab:ssv}  show that using pointwise 
quadratic cut cell gradients is roughly
a factor of 2 more accurate on coarser grids.  The more complicated second order
accurate gradient is even more accurate, especially on coarser grids.  Ultimately the gradient
error is reduced, and the error curves for the first and second order 
accurate gradients approach each other. 


We also use this example to compare the effect of state redistribution versus 
marching to steady state using local time-stepping without SRD.  
Table  \ref{tab:ssv2} shows a comparison of the error in the converged
solution using local time stepping (LTS)  without SRD, and the error with full timesteps and
SRD stabilization, both using  first order accurate gradients. 
The convergence rates and errors are essentially identical, showing that 
SRD does not degrade the computed solution with too much diffusion due
to the merging neighborhoods. This holds across all the other
gradient formulations too.

\subsection{Shock Reflection from  Cylinder}
Next we demonstrate the method using a Mach 2
shock diffracting around a circular cylinder. 
The shock will come in to cut cells are all angles in the mesh, so this
example will demonstrate the robustness of SRD, and demonstrate the
smoothness of the density profile around the cylinder, despite the
completely irregular mesh.

A cylinder with radius $0.15$ is centered at
(0.5,0.5), and the shock is initially located at $x = 0.2$.
For this example we compare results using the MUSCL scheme and
the Method of Lines as the base schemes, both using local Lax Friedrichs for the Riemann
solver. Both methods use second order accurate gradients. The BJ 
limiter is used to limit
both the base scheme irregular cells  and tile reconstruction gradients. 
The CFL for the MUSCL scheme was 0.85, and for the MOL
scheme was 1.0 using \eqref{eq:vn1}, based on the full cell volumes.

Figure \ref{fig:cyl1} left shows the solution density from MUSCL, and
right from MOL, at time $t=0.25$. 
Both grids use 302 cells in each
directions, and the domain is  $[0.0,1.00001,]$ by  $[0.0, 1.0]$, again to
prevent mesh degeneracies.
There are 416 cut cells
around the cylinder; 160 of the cut cells had volume fractions less than
0.5 and were stabilized with SRD.  The smallest volume fraction was 1.17e-4.   
For comparison, this is also the time shown in \cite{mjb-hel-rjl:hbox2}. 
Here and in \cite{mjb-hel-rjl:hbox2}, the solution in front of the cylinder 
where the
maximum density is found is better behaved with the one-step methods than with
MOL.  The method of lines solution is smoother around the boundary than our
MUSCL variant. 
%(see Figure \ref{fig:cylbndry}).

producing a smooth solution around the cylinder, 
but interestingly, the profiles are rather different from each other.

\subsection{Double Mach Reflection problem}\label{sec:dm}
We present one final standard test case for embedded
boundary meshes. We reflect a Mach 10 shock obliquely over a wedge, 
where the shock and wall form a $60^{\circ}$ angle.  
The problem domain is $[0,3.0]\times[0,1.75]$, with an angled wall 
passing through the point $(1/6,0)$. 
We use the MUSCL scheme, with the interior slopes 
computed using monotonized central differences. The irregular cells and
SRD neighborhoods use second order accurate 
gradients, and limit using BJ.
The CFL is 0.85.

The solution to this problem is a complex, self-similar reflection pattern 
composed of incident and reflected shocks and contact 
discontinuities \cite{WOODWARD1984115,rkdg5}.  
The contact discontinuities are an unstable feature of the solution that can be 
difficult to resolve correctly, especially in the neighborhood of the 
reflecting boundary where the carbuncle phenomenon can occur \cite{KEMM2018596}.

The solution at the final time $T = 0.2$ is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:dm}, 
where the grid resolution is $\Delta x = \Delta y = 1/240$.
We obtain qualitatively comparable results to those in \cite{rkdg5} on 
the same grid resolution. We also show for comparison the results using 
$\Delta x = \Delta y = 1/480$, also done in \cite{rkdg5}. Again, the
improvement is very similar. Finally, in Figure \ref{fig:wedgeBndry} we
show the density along the boundary for the two resolutions. Despite the
irregularity of the cut cells, the solution is very smooth. The smallest
cut cell in the coarser grid has volume fraction 1.65e-6. On the finest
grid the smallest volume fraction is 2.95e-7.
