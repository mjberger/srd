\section{Computational Results}\label{sec:compResults}
In this section we show several computational experiments using state
redistribution to solve the Euler
equations. We will also use these
examples to examine 
properties of different gradient choices and base schemes. 
%We solve the conservation law \eqref{eq:conslaw2D} with different fluxes $\mathbf{F}$, to include both smooth and discontinuous
%solutions.

%\subsection{Linear fluxes}
%\subsubsection{Linear convergence study}
%We solve \eqref{eq:conslaw2D} with the flux $\mathbf{F}(u) = [-2\pi y u, 2\pi x u]$ and initial condition
%$$
%u_0(x,y) = w(\theta - \pi/2)
%$$
%where
%$$
%w(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\left( \text{erf}\left( \frac{\pi/6 - \theta}{\sqrt{4/100}} \right) + \text{erf}\left( \frac{\pi/6 + \theta}{\sqrt{4/100}} \right)\right)
%$$
%until the final time $T = 1$ on the domain enclosed by two concentric disks of 
%radii $R_1 = 0.751$ and $R_2 = 1.251$.  
%Figure \ref{fig:rotatinghillgrid} shows the computational domain 
%embedded in a $50 \times 50$ grid.  The exact solution is the initial condition 
%rotated about the point $(1.5,1.5)$, where $T=1$ corresponds to one solid 
%body rotation. This example IS FROM \cite{}, for comparison.  (AND ADD
%COMPARISON - ARE THEY OR WE MORE ACCURATE< BUT WE ARE EASIER).   
%The errors 
%measured in the $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ norms are provided in 
%Tables \ref{tab:ex1_L1} and \ref{tab:ex1_Linf}.  Figure
%\ref{fig:rotatinghillexactiso} shows isolines of solution at the initial 
%and final time.  The exact solution is applied as the boundary condition.

%\subsubsection{Overlapping neighborhoods}
%The purpose of this example is to demonstrate that our algorithm can handle a substantial number of overlapping neighborhoods.  
%Using the streamfunction
%$$
%\phi = R - 0.25\sin(10\theta),
%$$
%with $R = \sqrt{(x-1.5)^2+(y-1.5)^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan((y-1.5)/(x-1.5))$, we define a linear flux based on the resulting divergence free velocity field, i.e.,  $\mathbf{F}(u) = [\phi_y u, -\phi_xu]$.  The characteristics of \eqref{eq:conslaw} lie on the isolines of the streamfunction.
%
%A steady state solution to \eqref{eq:conslaw} with the above flux is given by the streamline function.  Therefore, we start with the initial condition given by the streamline function $\phi$, and compute the solution until the final time $T = 10$ on a $100 \times 100$ grid.  Additionally, we set the flux normal the domain boundary $\mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{n} = 0$.  This is to ensure that information does not leave the domain and should solution growth occur, this will more easily be noticed.
%This problem is solved using the finite volume TVD-RK2 scheme.

%In Figure \ref{fig:waveyisolines}, we show the isolines of the exact solution at the initial and final times.  Additionally, Figure \ref{fig:waveynumhoods} shows the number of overlapping neighborhoods on each cell.  In this example, we have at most three overlapping neighborhoods.  They are concentrated where the boundary has high curvature.   We do not observe growth in the numerical solution as indicated by $L_1$, $L_\infty$ errors of the solution at the final time listed in Table \ref{tab:overlappingerrors}.  Although this experiment does not prove stability of our numerical scheme, not observing unbounded growth in the numerical solution is a necessary condition.


%\subsection{Nonlinear fluxes}
\subsection{Supersonic vortex study}\label{sec:ssv}
We compute the solution to a supersonic flow 
around a quarter circle.  This problem has often been used in accuracy 
studies \cite{aftosmis:acc} since it has an exact solution to the Euler
equations that is smooth, given by 
\begin{equation}
\rho = \rho_i \left \{ 1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2} \, M_i^2 \left [ 1 - (\frac{r_i}{r})^2
\right ] \right \} ^
{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}
\end{equation}
and $ u = a_i \, M_i \, (\frac{r_i}{r})\,  \sin (\theta)$, 
$ v = a_i\,  M_i\,  (\frac{r_i}{r})\,  \cos(\theta)$, and
$ p = \rho^\gamma / \gamma$.
Here, the inner radius is $r_i = 1.0$,  the outer radius
is $r = 1.384$, $\rho_i=1$, and the Mach number on the inner circle
$M_i = 2.25$ in our experiments. 
In this
normalization we use $a_i = 1$, $p_i = 1/\gamma$. 
The second order MOL scheme is used, and we march
to steady state, until the maximum density update is below $10^{-10}$.  
The solution is smooth, so no limiters are needed.
The exact solution is used to set the ghost cells at the inflow and
outflow boundaries. The domain size is 1.43 by 1.4301 (slightly different
to prevent mesh  degeneracies).  

In Table \ref{tab:ssv} we compare the accuracy of three different formulations
for the cut cell gradients. 
For first order accurate gradients, we use a linear least squares reconstruction for
both the irregular cell gradient (cut cells and their one-away neighbors) 
described in Section \ref{sec:limit}, and the SRD gradients, which 
update the cut cell solution after stabilization. Second order accurate 
gradients fit a quadratic for both
the cut cells and tiles as described in Section \ref{sec:limit}, 
but only the first derivative terms are used. 
As an intermediate experiment, we  fit a quadratic using least squares but treating the
cell averages as pointwise values at the cell centers. Here again
the second derivative terms are ignored.  Note that this is not
second order accurate, since the centroid value differs by $O(h^2)$
from the pointwise value at the centroid. Nevertheless, this is frequently
done since it is easier to implement, in particular for the SRD neighborhoods
with irregular shapes.

        for the supersonic vortex example. The error using first order accurate
        gradients, pointwise quadratic, and fully second order accurate gradients is shown. 
        Pointwise quadratic gradients have half of the error than first order gradients. 
        Truly second order accurate gradients are even better, especially on coarser grids. \label{tab:ssv}}
\end{table}
}

We measure the $L_1$ norm of the error in the volume,   $\sum_{i,j} \,
V_{ij} \lvert e_{ij } \rvert$ and at the boundary, $ \sum_{{i,j} \in \partial \Omega} \, A_{ij} \lvert e_{ij
} \rvert$.  Here
$e_{i,j}$ is the error at the cell centroid, and $A_{ij}$ is the length of the 
boundary segment in cut cell $(i,j)$.
These are given in Table \ref{tab:ex1_L1vol} and \ref{tab:ex1_L1bndry}. 
For easier comparison with other papers we also give the mesh size 
to a few digits. In  a cut cell mesh there are both solid and
flow cells, so the total number of cell is larger than the number of
flow cells, and not as easy to compare as the mesh spacing.
All interior cells use the evolution scheme and gradients, so
the difference in the errors are solely due to the cut cell gradients.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[height=3.0in]{figs/gradientConv.pdf}
		\caption{\sf Convergence in the L1 norm of the error in the entire 
			domain  (solid line), and along the boundary (dashed line).
			The reference line has slope 2 next to the domain error. The convergence
			rate at the boundary is between 1.38 and 1.5
			along the boundary.
			\label{fig:ssv}}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


Note that the error at the cut cells is larger than in the volume, and has a
slower convergence rate. Since the number of cut cells grows only
linearly with refinement, the $L_1$
accuracy in the entire flow field is still second order.  At the boundary,
Richardson extrapolation shows that the convergence rate seems to be
between 1.38 and 1.5.
This has also been found in other cut cell studies \cite{KB:2006,nemec_tm14}, and 
is not due to SRD.

Figure \ref{fig:ssv} and Table \ref{tab:ssv}  show that using pointwise 
quadratic cut cell gradients is roughly
a factor of 2 more accurate on coarser grids.  The more complicated second order
acccurate gradient is even more accurate, especially on coarser grids.  Ultimately the gradient
error is reduced, and the error curves for the first and second order 
accurate gradients approach each other. 


We also use this example to compare the effect of state redistribution versus 
marching to steady state using local time-stepping without SRD.  
Table  \ref{tab:ssv2} shows a comparison of the error in the converged
solution using local time stepping (LTS)  without SRD, and the error with full timesteps and
SRD stabilization, both using  first order accurate gradients. 
The errors are essentially identical, showing that 
SRD does not degrade the computed solution with too much diffusion due
to the merging neighborhoods. This holds across all the other
gradient formulations too.

\subsection{Shock Reflection from  Cylinder}
Next we demonstrate the method for the Euler equations using a Mach 2
shock diffracting around a circular cylinder. A cylinder with radius $0.15$ is centered at
(0.5,0.5), and the shock is initially located at $x = 0.2$.
For this example we compare results using the MUSCL scheme and
the Method of Lines as the base schemes, both using local Lax Friedrichs for the Riemann
solver. The BJ limiter is used to limit
both the base scheme irregular cells  and tile reconstruction gradients. 

Figure \ref{fig:cyl1} (left) shows the solution density from MUSCL, and
right from MOL, at time $t=0.25$. 
Both grids use 302 cells in each
directions, and the domain is  $[0.0,0.0,]$ by  $[1.00001, 1.0]$, again to
prevent mesh degeneracies.
There are 416 cut cells
around the cylinder; 160 of the cut cells had volume fractions less than
0.5 and were stabilized with SRD.  The smallest volume fraction was 1.17E-4.   
For comparison, this is also the time shown in \cite{mjb-hel-rjl:hbox2}. 
Here and in \cite{mjb-hel-rjl:hbox2}, the front of the cylinder where the
maximum density is found is better behaved with the one-step methods than with
MOL.  The method of lines solution is smoother around the boundary than our
MUSCL variant (see Figure \ref{fig:cylbndry}).

\subsection{Double Mach Reflection problem}
In this section, we reflect a Mach 10 shock obliquely over a wedge, where the shock and wall form a $60^{\circ}$ angle.  
This problem is solved on $[0,3]\times[0,2]$, with an angled wall embedded in the domain (Figure \ref{fig:dmnca}).  
We use the finite volume TVD-RK2 scheme with second order slopes on the base grid and neighborhoods, limited using Barth Jeserpsen.
%The goal of this test is to demonstrate that qualitatively comparable solutions are obtained, regardless of the orientation of the embedded boundary with respect to the underlying Cartesian grid.  
The solution to this problem is a complex, self-similar reflection pattern composed of incident and reflected shocks, Mach stem, and a contact discontinuity \cite{WOODWARD1984115}.  
The contact discontinuity is an unstable feature of the solution that can be difficult to resolve correctly, especially in the neighborhood of the reflecting boundary, e.g., carbuncle phenomenon \cite{KEMM2018596}.

The solution at the final time $T = 0.2$ is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:dm}, where the grid resolution is $\Delta x = \Delta y = 1/120$.

%We solve this shock reflection problem on a domain with a coordinate-aligned reflecting wall and on another domain with a non-coordinate-aligned reflecting wall.
%The former is the rectangular domain $[0,4] \times [0,1]$, where shock intersects the horizontal wall at $(0.5,0)$ (Figure \ref{fig:dmca}).
