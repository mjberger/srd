\begin{enumerate}
\item
A postprocessing technique called state redistribution is developed to solve the small cell problem on cut cell meshes.

\item
The algorithm is applied after each step or stage of an explicit finite volume scheme, where the time step is chosen based on the full cell volume.

\item 
The algorithm is easier to implement than cell merging since it allows
for (temporarily) overlapping merging neighborhoods, and only requires
the centroids and volumes of cells in a small neighborhood of each cut cell.

\item 
The approach is linearity preserving, conservative, and does not reduce the accuracy of the base scheme.
